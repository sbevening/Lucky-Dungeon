# Lucky Dungeon

## Objective and Game Flow:

The primary goal of Lucky Dungeon will be to advance through a randomly
generated, unique dungeon full of different monsters and treasure by
rolling some dice! As you traverse the dungeon, you will find loads
of different **weapons**, with different levels of power and durability,
and are placed in your inventory to use at any time, and **armor** which
will reduce the damage you take when your opponent attacks you.

If at any point during your adventure that you grow tired, you can
have your adventurer take a rest and return to the dungeon once they
are rested. Traverse through the linear dungeon, do anything in your
power to protect your own life, and get as far as you can in the endless
dungeon.

## Why I Chose This Project

This game can be enjoyed by gamers who play dungeon crawler games and
turned base strategy. I personally spend a lot of my time playing
games centered around both of these features and wanted to create my own
iteration on the dungeon crawler formula. I also want to experiment with
pseudo-random generation of dungeons and how to go about creating
interesting battles that lend to replayability.
